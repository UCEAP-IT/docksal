## Installing Docksal on Windows

### 1. Install Babun

Install [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) and run all further commands in Babun.

!!! danger "Install as a regular user"
    Babun should be installed and run **as a regular user** (do **NOT** run as Administrator to install).

Docksal is not tested and does not support other Linux-type shells on Windows.

### 2. Install Docksal

curl -fsSL get.docksal.io | sh
```

### 3. Create and start the vm

```bash
fin vm start
```

### 4. Congratulations!

You are done with the one time environment installation. Now you can [configure your project](../getting-started/project-setup.md) to use Docksal or create a new pre-configured Drupal or Wordpress project with `fin project create`.

!!! info "Experimental support for Native Docker applications"
    Advanced Docker users may want to check out how to use Docksal with [Native Docker applications](../getting-started/env-setup-native.md).

## Installing Docksal on Ubuntu Linux

### 1. Avoid conflict with Apache

By default Apache listens on `0.0.0.0:80` and `0.0.0.0:443`. This will prevent Docksal from running properly.

You either need to stop Apache or reconfigure it to listen on different ports (e.g. `8080` and `4433`) or different host (e.g. `127.0.0.1:80` and `127.0.0.1:443`).

### 2. Install Docksal

```bash
curl -fsSL get.docksal.io | sh
```

### 3. Congratulations!

You are done with the one time environment installation. Now you can [configure your project](project-setup.md) to use Docksal or create a new pre-configured Drupal or Wordpress project with `fin project create`.
